"""Form (form definition) tools.

⚠️ UNVERIFIED — built entirely from the API contract pasted into ClickUp
PRD-15818 (per Leo Yang's comment), not by reading the actual backend repo.
Endpoint paths/params/response shapes below match that doc; none have been
called against a real deployment. See README Known Gaps.

Note: the underlying REST API's own paths/fields still say "survey"
(`/surveys`, `surveyVersionId`, ...) — those are the real backend's wire
contract and are left untouched. Only the agent-facing tool names,
parameters, and descriptions here say "form".
